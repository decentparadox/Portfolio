        Hey, I'm Sasank Reddy, but you can call me "DecentParadox." I'm studying
        Computer Science at Amrita School of Engineering. I like designing and
        coding, and sometimes I play CTFs. I also have fun making challenges for
        CTFs.
      </p>

        I'm a student who loves learning. I may not have a fancy mission, but my
        passion for gaining knowledge and mastering new skills keeps me going.
