Hey, not much happening, just got a demat account on Zerodha. Been learning about stocks while managing my semester and personal projects. One of them involves creating my own tech stack, a challenge I took to understand the technologies I use.
  
Recently, I revamped the website to make it more functional and purposeful. Also, built websites for freelance clients and started an internship, working on an exciting project.  
  
Tried a new snack combo with [Arhant](https://dumbprism.me), our own version college canteen's hot chocolate mixed with Dairy Milk.
