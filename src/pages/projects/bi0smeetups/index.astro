          The challenge for organizing meetups effectively stemmed from the lack
          of a centralized, professional, and user-friendly registration system.
          Using tools like Google Forms was functional but lacked the
          professional polish expected from India's #1 CTF and cybersecurity
          research team. Additionally, relying on external tools meant less
          control over the user data and experience, which could affect the
          trust and perception of attendees.

              Handling registrations, attendee lists, and updates through
              multiple tools can cause friction and inefficiencies. A dedicated
              platform can streamline these processes into a unified system.

              Using basic tools for registrations might give an impression of
              unpreparedness. A professional website reflects the high standards
              and capabilities of the team behind the event.

              External tools like Google Forms limit the control over user

          So, we all agreed to keep the website&#39;s look consistent. It took
          me almost a week to finish the design, set up the site, and pick the
          content. Since this was my first big project, I&#39;m thinking of
          writing a blog about the process and why I made those decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The entire website got rewritten twice. At first, I used Astro, but
          since it&#39;s a niche framework, I realized it might be hard for
          others to manage the site later on. So, I switched to Next.js. This
          was also the first site I created entirely from scratch, no templates
          or themes used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from the awesome dynamic themes using CSS variables — check out <Link
            href="https://bi0smeetup.in/meetups/8"
            class="text-accent">https://bi0smeetup.in/meetups/8</Link
          > and play around with the number 8, going down to 1 — and the custom shadcn
          UI components that perfectly fit the site&#39;s theme, there&#39;s not
          a lot more to say about the frontend.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the website is actually built using a full TypeScript stack. We
          use Prisma and Neon PostgreSQL db for data storage, and Next Auth for
          authentication. Our aim was to set up something like Luma but with
          more control over our development. If you take a look at the user
          experience flow, you&#39;ll see it&#39;s similar to Luma, and we did
          borrow some of their UI too. And hey, if anyone from Luma is reading
          this, you all made an awesome web app! However, because of our design
          scheme, we had to start from scratch.

          Starting with data storage
        </div>
        <p>
          Back when we didn&#39;t have authentication, we simply took form
          responses and added them to Prisma. We relied on the <code
            >useLocalStorage</code
          > hook for state management. I realize this wasn&#39;t ideal as it impacted
          everything. It was also inefficient because a user could forget they registered
          for an event and try to register again from a different device. Since the
          venue provider had limited seats, we had to opt for authentication.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I decided to go with React Hook Form and Zod for form validation
          because they&#39;re super light and easy to use. Zod&#39;s validation
          based on schemas is neat and lets me handle all validation in one
          place, which I find better than dealing with it in each input field
          separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          I went with <code>useLocalStorageState</code> to check user registration.
          It&#39;s a super handy hook for keeping state in sync with local storage,
          even surviving page refreshes. This ensures users don&#39;t lose their
          registration info if they accidentally refresh, a nice touch for user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          In hindsight, it turned out to be a bad idea. Users can&#39;t tell if
          they registered from different devices, and without an expiry date,
          the next meetup page might still show you as registered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working with various meetups, I utilized the URL slug to dynamically
          load specific information for each event—such as fonts, colors, and
          descriptions. This allows each event page to have its own unique style
          while maintaining the site&#39;s consistency. Also, manually
          hard-coding all meetups would have been cumbersome—it&#39;s much
          easier to manage and scale this way.
        </p>

          so what&#39;s next? Auth?
        </div>
        <p>
          Let&#39;s talk about UX. I&#39;m not someone who delved into human
          philosophy to grasp user experience, but having to fill out forms
          every time during testing made me question its necessity. There was a
          point when we debated the need for authentication on a meetup page
          that simply displayed event information. However, we realized
          authentication was essential for future paid workshops, setting a
          strong foundation. Meetups will always remain free, but we aim to
          provide workshop materials exclusively to attendees rather than making
          them public—although with some website tinkering, you could still
          access them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The code is pretty much copied from the Next Auth docs website and
          adjusted to include onboarding features that will be added later. We
          plan to request users for their phone number, preferably WhatsApp, to
          send an RSVP message via the bot. Also, we&#39;d like to collect
          LinkedIn profiles to understand the industry and university
          distribution of our users.

          tabindex="0"
        >
          stuff like emails and QR
        </div>
        <p>
          We wanted to make signing up even easier by sending confirmation
          emails right after users register. We used <strong>Resend</strong> with
          <strong>React Email</strong> to send personalized emails. This gives users
          instant confirmation and adds a nice touch to the experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, we came up with a cool idea for event management - a <strong
            >QR code check-in system</strong
          >. Users receive a unique QR code in their confirmation email,
          allowing them to check in by simply scanning it at the event. This
          speeds up the check-in process, makes it contactless, and helps us
          keep track of attendance efficiently. By automating emails and using
          QR codes, we&#39;re streamlining our processes and ensuring smooth
          operations on event day.

          Working on this website for bi0s Meetups has been so fulfilling.
          I&#39;ve picked up a ton of new skills, from creating a system
          that&#39;s both practical and visually appealing to handling data
          storage and improving user experience with features like
          authentication, emails, and QR code check-ins. It really made me
          rethink how event registration and management should be done, and
          I&#39;m really happy with the result. Each obstacle was a chance to
          learn something fresh, whether it was about frontend design or backend
          choices to ensure the platform can grow smoothly. I&#39;m really
          looking forward to what&#39;s next and how this project will keep
          evolving as our meetups expand! Reflecting on the process, I recognize
          my growth as a designer and developer through these three key lessons:

            Mastering the art of creating unique experiences:
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-4 leading-5 text-stone-300 max-md:max-w-full">
            By designing distinct themes for every meetup, including unique
            color schemes, font styles, and tailored graphics, I understood the
            value of branding in fostering engagement. This practice not only
            amplified the platform's visual appeal but also strengthened its
            identity.

          </h3>
          <p class="mt-4 leading-5 text-stone-300 max-md:max-w-full">
            Developing a platform for seamless registration and information
            sharing required striking a balance between aesthetics and
            usability. I learned to prioritize functionality while ensuring the
            platform retained its innovative and professional look.
